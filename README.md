# What is DevOps

- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working 
together in the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to production 
support

## Why DevOps - Benefits

- Faster delivery time - the key features of DevOps are automation, 
continuous delivery, and quick feedback cycles, resulting in a faster 
software development process
- High collaboration between teams - by bridging them gap between 
development and operations, DevOps improves business 
agility due to a greater level of collaboration and communication 
between different departments which decreases problems arising as a 
result of miscommunication or conflicts between departments
- Greater customer experience - DevOps speeds up the entire lifecycle of 
product development and delivery, and by automating the delivery 
pipeline, it becomes possible to ensure the reliability and stability of 
an application after every new release, benefiting the customer base

## DevOps tools

- Docker - Linux-based open-source platform that focuses on containers 
ie packaging up software with its dependencies and shipping everything 
together as a unit
- Ansible - Open-source tool for automating software provisioning, 
configuration management, and application deployment
- Git - open-source tool that allows you to coordinate worrk among team 
members and track development progress

## Cloud computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services ie 
applications, storage, processing power etc. on a pay-as-you-go basis
- Instead of buying their own computing infrastructure and data centers, 
companies can rent access to computing services from a cloud service 
provider
- A benefit is avoiding the cost and space required to own and 
maintain computing infrastructure. They can instead just pay cloud 
services for what they use, when they use it
