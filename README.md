# What is DevOps

- DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working 
together in the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to production 
support

## Why DevOps - Benefits

- Faster delivery time - the key features of DevOps are automation, 
continuous delivery, and quick feedback cycles, resulting in a faster 
software development process
- High collaboration between teams - by bridging them gap between 
development and operations, DevOps improves business 
agility due to a greater level of collaboration and communication 
between different departments which decreases problems arising as a 
result of miscommunication or conflicts between departments
- Greater customer experience - DevOps speeds up the entire lifecycle of 
product development and delivery, and by automating the delivery 
pipeline, it becomes possible to ensure the reliability and stability of 
an application after every new release, benefiting the customer base

## DevOps tools

- Docker - Linux-based open-source platform that focuses on containers 
ie packaging up software with its dependencies and shipping everything 
together as a unit
- Ansible - Open-source tool for automating software provisioning, 
configuration management, and application deployment
- Git - open-source tool that allows you to coordinate worrk among team 
members and track development progress

## Cloud computing

- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services ie 
applications, storage, processing power etc. on a pay-as-you-go basis
- Instead of buying their own computing infrastructure and data centers, 
companies can rent access to computing services from a cloud service 
provider
- A benefit is avoiding the cost and space required to own and 
maintain computing infrastructure. They can instead just pay cloud 
services for what they use, when they use it

## SAAS, PAAS, IAAS

### SAAS

- Software as a service - SaaS utilises the internet to deliver 
applications which are managed by a third-party vendor
- SaaS eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install 
applications on each individual computer
- typically used for short-term projects that require quick, easy, and 
affordable collaboration, applications that aren't needed that often, 
and applications that need both web and mobile access

### PAAS

- Platform as a service - PaaS provides cloud components to certain 
software while being used mainly for applications. it delivers a 
framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create 
customised applications
- PaaS is useful when multiple developers are working on the same 
development project because it can streamline workflows

### IAAS

- Infrastructure as a service - IaaS is made up of highly scalable and 
automated computer resources, and allows businesses to purchase 
resources on-demand and as-needed instead of having to buy hardware
- IaaS is useful for startups and small companies that who might want to 
avoid spending time and money on purchasing aand creating 
hardware/software. also useful for companinies experiencing rapid growth 
because of its scalability

## On-prem/localhost

- On-prem ie on premises, referes to the software and technology that is 
located within the physical cofines of an enterprise
- localhost is a hostname used to refer to the current computer being 
used to access network services

## Public and hybrid clouds

- public cloud is cloud computing that's devlivered through the 
internetand shared across organisations (unlike private cllouds ie 
on-prem that to which only the localhost has access)
- Hybrid cloud is any environment that used both public and private 
clouds depending on the needs and tasks at hand
